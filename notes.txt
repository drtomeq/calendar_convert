Program to change a Google calendar export to csv format to be used in spreadsheets.

It probably wount work for all events, I only tested for my own events.

One ommission from the Google calendar export was the colour.  This has caused all kinds of trouble as my events were colour coded.

As of writing was in a working state but with errors
In future should have more functions to organise dates and finances
